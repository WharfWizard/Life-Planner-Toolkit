# What is Life Planning?

Life Planning is the art of planning **life first, money second**.  
It is about discovering what truly matters to you — your purpose, relationships, wellbeing, and contribution — and then aligning your financial decisions to support that vision.

---

## Why Life Planning?
Traditional financial planning often starts with products, investments, or retirement pots.  
But without clarity of purpose, those numbers lack meaning.

Life Planning asks:
- Who do you want to become?
- What impact do you want to make?
- How can your money serve your life — not the other way round?

---

## The Principles
1. **Holistic** — considers health, relationships, work, spirit, and environment.  
2. **Human Capital First** — skills, time, and networks are your greatest assets.  
3. **Transparent** — no hidden products or agendas.  
4. **Empowering** — puts autonomy and dignity back in your hands.  

---

## The GAME Plan
Life Planning is structured through the **GAME Plan** cycle:

- **Goals** – Define what truly matters (your S.T.O.R.I.E.S).  
- **Actions** – Break goals into habits and next steps.  
- **Means** – Take stock of your resources (human + financial capital).  
- **Execution** – Put the plan into practice, review, and adapt.  

> Plan life → then plan money. That is the path to sovereignty and balance.

## Who Is It For?
- Individuals seeking clarity and fulfilment.  
- Families navigating change or recovery.
