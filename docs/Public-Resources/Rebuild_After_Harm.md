# Rebuild After Harm

If you’ve been harmed financially, emotionally, or spiritually — recovery is possible.  
This guide offers simple steps and resources to help you move forward with dignity and strength.

## Three Pillars of Recovery

### 1. Stability
Secure your essentials first.  
- Safety: remove yourself from harmful situations  
- Shelter: ensure housing stability  
- Food & health: meet basic needs before anything else  

### 2. Support
No one rebuilds alone.  
- Connect with trusted peers, mentors, or charities  
- Join communities where your voice is respected  
- Share your story — healing begins with being heard  

### 3. Self-Rebuild
Use the **GAME Plan** to regain autonomy and purpose.  
- **Goals** – Clarify what matters most to you now  
- **Actions** – Take small steps, one habit at a time  
- **Means** – Take stock of your time, skills, and relationships  
- **Execution** – Review progress and celebrate milestones
