# The GAME Plan

**Goals • Actions • Means • Execution**

The GAME Plan is a simple, repeatable cycle that helps you plan **life first, money second**.  
It is both ancient in its wisdom and practical for today — a framework that restores autonomy, dignity, and purpose.

---

## 1. Goals
- Define what truly matters to you.  
- Use the **S.T.O.R.I.E.S. framework** (Standards, Talents, Objectives, Rich, Illness, Estate, Statement).  
- Write down a clear vision of your Kokoro — a life of balance and fulfilment.

---

## 2. Actions
- Break down big goals into small, achievable steps.  
- Build new habits that move you closer every day.  
- Identify obstacles and remove them systematically.  
- Create accountability through reviews, trackers, or trusted partners.

---

## 3. Means
- Take stock of your **human capital** (time, skills, relationships).  
- Assess your **financial capital** (income, cashflow, assets).  
- Align these resources to your Goals, ensuring money serves your life — not the other way round.

---

## 4. Execution
- Put your plan into practice.  
- Review regularly (weekly, monthly, annually).  
- Adapt as life changes, and celebrate your progress.  
- Use a **Decision Journal** to learn from experience.

## Why It Matters
Most financial systems start with **Execution** (work harder, buy products, save for later).  
This “reversed cycle” extracts wealth and limits autonomy.  

The **GAME Plan flips the cycle back** to its natural order — restoring empowerment and giving people the tools to thrive.
