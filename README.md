## 🎯 The Framework
The **GAME Plan** restores the natural cycle of empowerment:

- **G – Goals**: Define what truly matters (using the **S.T.O.R.I.E.S.** lens: Self, Tribe, Opportunity, Resources, Impact, Environment, Spirit)  
- **A – Actions**: Break goals into habits, remove obstacles, take small steps  
- **M – Means**: Take stock of time, skills, relationships, and financial resources  
- **E – Execution**: Put plans into practice, review regularly, course-correct  

> Plan life → then plan money. That’s the path to sovereignty and balance.
